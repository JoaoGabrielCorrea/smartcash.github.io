                    <p>The SmartHive has a place for folks of all backgrounds. Come hungry!</p>

                    <p>We believe ‘Core’ teams are a bad idea and something that ultimately leads to inefficiency and corruption. We are organized in hives inspired by ant and bee colonies.</p>
                    
                    <p>We have created the BusyBee portal to efficiently allocate energy into the areas that are needed.  With our innovative bidding system anyone can submit bids do do a project and get paid.</p>
