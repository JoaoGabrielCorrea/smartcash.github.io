title: "SmartCash Hive Teams"
description: "SmartCash is aiming to create a decentralized team structure by efficiently distributing the workload across multiple global Hive teams. The teams below are simply getting things started. After SmartCash starts to require more teams they will be created and these will be splintered into smaller teams."

                    <p>The SmartHive has a place for folks of all backgrounds. Come hungry!</p>

                    <p>We believe ‘Core’ teams are a bad idea and something that ultimately leads to inefficiency and corruption. We want to move past it and create a decentralized organizational model inspired by ant and bee colonies.</p>
                    
                    <p>In order to create and maintain a decentralized governance structure, we are introducing two concepts SmartHive and Hive Structuring Teams (HST). SmartHive enables anyone that holds coins the opportunity to vote on proposals submitted by the community. SmartHive will be the lifeblood of the project, which will allow anyone to get involved and submit proposals, helping to generate organic growth at a grassroots level, creating a bottom-up management structure.</p>
